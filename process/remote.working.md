# OHC Remote Working

OHC is a small & dynamic company.

As such, all work will involve remote working.

As much working is remote working, approval for remote working is implied by either:

* OHC employing a person
* OHC contracting a third party to conduct work on it's behalf.

We ask that you take a few simple steps in order to make sure that this works as smoothly as possible.

* Try not to be burgled. (This may include having locks on whatever premises you do work from.)
* Have passwords on your computers.
* Have passwords on any third party services you use to conduct OHC work (e.g. Email, Github, IRC)
