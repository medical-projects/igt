# OHC Remote Working

OHC is a small & dyamic company, with neithr physical premesis or physical assets.

As such, all working will be remote working.

As all working is remote working, approval for remote working is implied by either:

* OHC employing a person
* OHC contracting a third party to conduct work on it's behalf.

We ask that you take a few simple steps in order to make sure that this works as smoothly as possible.

* Try not to be burgled. (This may include having locks on whatever premesis you do work from.)
* Have passwords on your computers.
* Have passwords on any third party services you use to conduct OHC work (e.g. Email, Github, IRC)
