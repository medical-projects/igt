# Information Governance Policy

This is the information governance policy document for OHC. This policy is required to safeguard the movement of personal
identifiable data in the organisation.

In order to comply with NHS Information Governance requirements, OHC aims to be fully compliant with the Level 3 requirements for a commercial third party working with the NHS [1].

Responsibility for achieving this lies with the Information Governance Lead (IGL).

All staff are required to comply with NHS Information Governance best practices as appropriate to their role. More details on this will be provided by the IGL individually.

All information governance related documents, and their history can be located in this repository.

Breaches of Information Governance will be taken seriously and will result in disciplinary action, including termination of contract for serious breaches.
