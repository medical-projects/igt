# Information flows

## UK Or Not

There are no flows of personal data to a country outside the United Kingdom.

## Flows of Information

OHC only processes confidential personal information as a third party on behalf
of other NHS organizations.

As such, we only do so within the confines of the existing infrastructure of those
organizations - there are no data flows that cross those boundaries.
