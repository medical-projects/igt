## Attainment: Level 3 (Previous 1)

Information incidents include a loss/breach of staff/patient/service user personal data, a breach of confidentiality or other effect on the confidentiality, information security or quality of staff/patient/service user information. All incidents and near-misses should be reported, recorded and appropriately managed so that where incidents do occur, the damage from them is minimised and lessons are learnt from them. An Information Governance Serious Incident Requiring Investigation (IG SIRI) deemed reportable to national bodies e.g. the Information Commissioner, should be recorded and communicated via the IG Toolkit Incident Reporting Tool.

<h3>Level 1.</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>
  Responsibility for leading on the management and reporting of information incidents
