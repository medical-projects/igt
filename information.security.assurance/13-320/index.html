TODO: incident reporting procedure/template

<h4>b.</h4>
<p>
  Staff members have been informed of the incident reporting procedures and in particular

</p>
TODO: Meeting informing staff

<h4>c.</h4>
<p>
  Any information incidents that arise are reported to the senior management team

  Reports include details of investigations or action taken and detail any possible
  countermeasures.
</p>
TODO: Completed incident forms

<h3>Level 3.</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>
  Providing staff with procedures for reporting incidents does not provide sufficient
  assurance that the procedures have been understood and are being followed. Therefore
  compliance checks and routine monitoring are conducted.
</p>
TODO: Report on compliance

<h4>b.</h4>
<p>
  Information incidents and near-misses are appropriately discussed with staff and where
  necessary, retraining is carried out or new security measures are implemented.
</p>
TODO: Lessons learned documents

<h4>c. (Year 2 only)</h4>
<p>
  No matter how good existing procedures are weaknesses will always become apparent.
  New threats and new systems or ways of working will expose these weaknesses and
  users on the ground are normally the first to identify them. Therefore, staff should be
  encouraged to report anything they feel threatens security, and this approach needs to
  be adopted during induction training.
