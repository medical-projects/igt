  Unauthorised access to the premises,
  equipment, records and other assets is
  prevented
</p>

<h3>Level 1</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>
  A risk assessment has been undertaken to identify areas of the premises that are at risk
  of unauthorised access. This covers the premises as a whole, and takes into account
  legitimate entry/exit points, areas where forced entry is possible and any unstaffed parts
  of the premises.

  of unauthorised access.

<h4>b.</h4>
<p>
  Staff members, including new staff, have been informed about new security measures
  put in place and the process for reporting unauthorised access through team meetings
  or awareness sessions or staff briefing or induction materials.

<h3>Level 3.</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>
  All improvements identified by the risk assessment have been fully implemented to
  prevent unauthorised access to the premises, equipment, records and other assets.
</p>
TODO: New equipment/ways of working

<h4>b.</h4>
<p>
  Providing staff with guidance and procedures for protecting the premises, equipment,
  records and other assets does not provide sufficient assurance that the guidance and
  procedures have been understood and are being followed, therefore compliance spot
  checks and routine monitoring are conducted.
</p>
TODO: Report on compliance

<h4>c. (Year 2 only)</h4>
<p>
  It is important that physical security measures are subject to regular risk assessment
  and updated guidance or procedures are issued to reflect new risks due to new ways of
  working or the purchase of new equipment.
</p>
TODO: Review security measures
