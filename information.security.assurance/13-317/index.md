<h1>Information Security Assurance</h1>
## 13-317
## Attainment: Level 3 (Previous 2)

It is important to ensure that the organisationâ€™s assets, premises, equipment, records and other assets including staff are protected by physical security measures.

<h3>Level 1</h3>

A risk assessment of physical security of the premises has been carried out and staff members have been informed of steps to take in the event of unauthorised access.

<h4>a.</h4>
A risk assessment has been undertaken to identify areas of the premises that are at risk of unauthorised access. This covers the premises as a whole, and takes into account legitimate entry/exit points, areas where forced entry is possible and any unstaffed parts of the premises.

<h3>Level 3.</h3>

All reasonable steps have been taken to ensure the premises, equipment, records and other assets are physically secured. Physical security measures are subject to regular risk assessment.

<h4>a.</h4>
All improvements identified by the risk assessment have been fully implemented to prevent unauthorised access to the premises, equipment, records and other assets.

_No new security equipment was required_

<h4>b.</h4>

Providing staff with guidance and procedures for protecting the premises, equipment, records and other assets does not provide sufficient assurance that the guidance and procedures have been understood and are being followed, therefore compliance spot checks and routine monitoring are conducted.
