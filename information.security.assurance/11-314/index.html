<p>
  Policy and procedures ensure that
  mobile computing and teleworking are
  secure
</p>

<h3>Level 1.</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>
  There are documented procedures for mobile working or teleworking that provide
  guidelines for staff on expected behaviours.
</p>
TODO: Remote working procedures

<h4>b.</h4>
<p>
  There is a documented policy for approvals and authorisation for mobile working and
  teleworking arrangements.
</p>
TODO: Policy for approving remote working

<h4>c.</h4>
<p>
  The documented approvals policy and procedures have been agreed by an appropriate
  senior manager or group.
</p>
TODO: Approval of remote working procedures

<h3>Level 2.</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>
  All mobile or teleworkers are appropriately approved and authorised, and records are
  maintained of all authorisations
</p>
TODO: Records of approval

<h4>b.</h4>
<p>
  Mobile or teleworkers are provided with procedures / guidelines.
</p>
TODO: Procedures fot staff.

<h4>c.</h4>
<p>
  Robust remote access solutions have been provided (For Local Authorities Only: -
  This could be a copy of the Current PSN CoCo certificate).
</p>
TODO: Technical specification <br />
TODO: Reports on number of users and equipment allocated

<h3>Level 3.</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>
  Providing staff with guidelines, procedures and briefings does not provide sufficient
  assurance that they have been understood and are being followed, therefore compliance
  spot checks and routine monitoring are conducted.
</p>
TODO: Report on compliance checks

<h4>b.</h4>
<p>
  Documented reviews are carried out to obtain assurance that the mobile and/or
  teleworking arrangements are only available to authorised users, all mobile devices and
  removable media are accounted for; secure remote access is in place and that sensitive
  or confidential information (including service user information) is encrypted, securely
  transported or stored in secure locations.
</p>
TODO: Audit report

<h4>c. (Year 2 only)</h4>
<p>
  The robustness of security and remote access controls may change over time. It is
  therefore important that the remote working procedures and guidelines are regularly
  reviewed to ensure they continue to be effective.
</p>
TODO: Report on the effectiveness.
