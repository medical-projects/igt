_OHC does not provide remote access solutions to any services containing patient data, only services on the public internet._

<h3>Level 3.</h3>

<p>
  Providing staff with guidelines, procedures and briefings does not provide sufficient
  assurance that they have been understood and are being followed, therefore compliance
  spot checks and routine monitoring are conducted.
