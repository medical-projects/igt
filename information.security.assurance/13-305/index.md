# Information Security Assurance
## 13-305
## Attainment: Level 3 (Previous 1)

Organisations should control access to Information Assets and systems by ensuring that system functionality is configured to support user access controls and by further ensuring that formal procedures are in place to control the allocation of access rights to local information systems and services. These procedures should cover all stages in the life-cycle of user access, from the initial registration of new users to the final de-registration of users who no longer require access to information systems and services. Special attention should be given to managing access rights which allow support staff to override system controls.

<h3>Level 1.</h3>

There are documented requirements for access controls for all key information assets identified in the organisations asset register. Access rights for specific individuals/groups have been agreed and documented in relation to these information assets.

<h4>a.</h4>
Responsibility for defining and documenting requirements for both system and user access controls have been assigned to appropriate staff/senior management.
