## Support Rota Change Review

As of July 2015 our support rotaing processes changed to split the load between on-call
support staff.

All staff on the rota have been appropriately trained in their IG obligations.

All practical operational processes remained the same as the previous arrangement.

* There are no flows of confidential data outside of our clients sites.
* OHC staff only view patient data in order to respond to specific user requests.
