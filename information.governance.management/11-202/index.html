<h3>Level 3.</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>
  Providing staff with guidance materials and briefings does not provide sufficient
  assurance that the guidance has been understood and is being followed, therefore
  compliance spot checks and routine monitoring are conducted.
</p>
TODO: Monitoring Form
TODO: Review of sharing

<h4>b.</h4>
<p>
  The purpose of staff following the guidelines is to ensure that information is shared in
  compliance with the law and is in line with the expectations of the public. Satisfaction
  surveys are used to check that service users understand their consent choices and feel
  that their wishes are respected.
</p>
TODO: Completed satisfaction survey

<h4>c. (Year 2 only)</h4>
<p>
  Policy and law change over time and it is important that the content of guidance is
  regularly reviewed and aligned with the latest central guidelines.
