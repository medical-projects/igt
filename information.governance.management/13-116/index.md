# Information Governance Management

## 13-116
### Attainment: Level 3 (Previous 1)

One of the ways in which an organisation can ensure it fulfils its legal and other responsibilities regarding confidential information is to ensure that all staff members (including temps, locums, students and volunteers) are fully informed of their own obligations to comply with information governance requirements.

### Level 1.

Action has been taken to determine whether contracts of staff, contractors and third parties contain clauses setting out IG responsibilities.

#### a.

An audit of personnel records, and contractor and other third party contracts has been undertaken to determine how many have written contracts that contain clauses that identify IG responsibilities.

#### b.

Appropriate contractual clauses covering compliance with IG linked to disciplinary procedures (where appropriate) have been drafted and signed off by senior management.

#### c.

An action plan has been developed to update existing contracts, where necessary, and ensure all new contracts include compliance with IG requirements as part of employment/service engagement processes.

### Level 2.

Appropriate clauses on compliance with IG have been put into all contracts and/or agreements.

#### a.

Building upon the existing contractual situation, all contracts for staff, contractors and other third party users who have access to confidential information or assets containing confidential information include compliance with information governance requirements, as part of employment or contracting processes.

Compliance with the clauses is monitored and assured. Formal contractual arrangements with staff, contractors and third parties are reviewed regularly.
