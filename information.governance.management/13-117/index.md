### Level 3.

Action is taken to test and follow up staff understanding of IG and additional support is provided where needs are identified. Training provision is regularly reviewed.



#### a.

Providing staff with IG training does not provide sufficient assurance that they have understood their IG responsibilities. Therefore, compliance checks and routine monitoring is undertaken to test staff understanding and to ensure procedures are being complied with, where necessary, actions are taken.
