# Guidelines

## Disclosure of confidential Information

### Data protection – looking after the information you hold about patients

If you handle and store information about identifiable, living people – for example,
about patients – you are legally obliged to protect that information.

Under the Data Protection Act, you must:

* only collect information that you need for a specific purpose;
* keep it secure;
* ensure it is relevant and up to date;
* only hold as much as you need, and only for as long as you need it; and
* allow the subject of the information to see it on request.

### Disclosure

* The only permitted disclosure is in order to comply with a subject access request.
