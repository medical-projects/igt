### Attainment: Level 3 (Previous 2)

There is a need to ensure that all transfers of personal and sensitive information (correspondence, faxes, email, telephone messages, transfer of patient records and other communications containing personal or sensitive information) are conducted in a secure and confidential manner. This is to ensure that information is not disclosed inappropriately, either by accident or design, whilst it is being transferred or communicated to, within or outside of the organisation.

### Levek 1.

All areas from which personal and sensitive information is transferred and received have been identified. A procedure is in place to ensure security and confidentiality is maintained.

<h3>Level 3.</h3>

Staff compliance with the procedure is monitored. The procedure is reviewed and evaluated on at least an annual basis.

Providing staff with guidance materials and briefings does not provide sufficient assurance that the guidance has been understood and is being followed, therefore compliance spot checks and routine monitoring are conducted.
