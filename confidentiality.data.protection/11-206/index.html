<h3>Level 2.</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>
  All staff members with the potential to access confidential personal information have
  been informed that monitoring and auditing of access is being carried out, of the need
  for compliance with confidentiality and security procedures and the sanctions for failure
  to comply. Staff might be informed through team meetings, awareness sessions, staff
  briefing materials, or staff may be provided with their own copy of the procedures.

<h4>b.</h4>
<p>
  The procedures have been effectively implemented and appropriate action is taken
  where confidentiality processes have been breached. Therefore staff compliance is
  monitored and there are case reviews if confidentiality processes have been breached.
