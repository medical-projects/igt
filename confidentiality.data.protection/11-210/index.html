<h1>Confidentiality</h1>
<h2>11-210</h2>
<p>
  All new processes, services, information
  systems, and other relevant information
  assets are developed and implemented
  in a secure and structured manner, and
  comply with IG security accreditation,
  information quality and confidentiality
  and data protection requirements
</p>

<h3>Level 1.</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>
  Responsibility for documenting a procedure to ensure that new or proposed changes to
  organisational processes or information assets are identified has been assigned to an
  individual or group.
</p>
<a href="/jobs/information.governance.lead.html">Job Description</a>

<h4>b.</h4>
<p>
  There is a documented procedure for the identification and assessment of new
  processes and information assets that might impact on information security,
  confidentiality and data protection, and information quality that sets out a range
  of responsibilities for those involved in making decisions about whether to permit
  implementation of a new process or information asset.
</p>
<a href="/jobs/information.governance.lead.html">Job Description</a>

<h4>c.</h4>
<p>
  The procedure also sets out a structured approach for appropriate IG security
  accreditation documentation, procedures and controls to ensure new information assets
  are developed and introduced in a secure manner.
</p>
TODO: Documented project management approach

<h3>Level 2.</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>
  All staff members that are likely to introduce new information processes or information
  assets are effectively informed about the requirement to obtain approval from the IG
  forum (or equivalent) at the proposal stage of the new process or information asset.
</p>
TODO: Staff awarenes minutes

<h4>b.</h4>
<p>
  All implementations of new processes and information assets follow the documented
  procedure, including adhering to the structured project management process for the
  implementation of new information assets. Information governance requirements are
  well defined and selected, and risks and issues are identified early and addressed
  routinely. An appropriate privacy impact assessment is carried out whenever a new
  process or information asset is likely to involve a new use or significantly change the
  way in which personal data is handled. Robust change control processes are applied

TODO: Change control documents

<h3>Level 3.</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>
  Specific project IG assurance processes are in place to review the new processes and
  information assets. Results are appropriately fed through to appropriate personnel/
  groups (eg information risk leads, IG group, project boards, etc). Where a need for
  improvement is identified, this is documented within plans and appropriate action taken.
</p>
TODO: Meeting notes for review

<h4>b.</h4>
<p>
  Providing staff with written materials or briefings does not provide sufficient assurance
  that the procedure has been understood and that the advice and approval of the IG
  group is obtained before new processes or information assets that might impact on
  information security, confidentiality and data protection, and information quality are
  introduced. Therefore, compliance spot checks and routine monitoring are conducted.
</p>
TODO: Report on outcome of compliance checks

<h4>c. (Year 2 only)</h4>
<p>
  Policy and law change over time and it is important that the content of the documented
  procedure and structured approach is regularly reviewed and aligned with the latest
  central guidelines.
